# 🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Efficiency Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores ways to **optimize net profitability** for NYC taxi drivers using the **NYC TLC Trip Record dataset**.  
While gross earnings offer a general picture, many hidden inefficiencies—such as long idle times and low-profit long-distance trips—impact actual income.  
This analysis focuses on identifying **efficient trip patterns** based on location, time, and trip characteristics to help drivers *work smarter, not harder*.

---

## 📊 Analysis

The dataset includes millions of taxi trip records across New York City. By exploring trends in **fare per mile**, **fare per minute**, **tip ratios**, and **idle times**, we aim to:

- Compare **earnings efficiency** across boroughs and zones.
- Identify **high-demand areas** with low waiting times between trips.
- Discover **optimal hours and zones** for short, high-return trips.
- Map **low-efficiency routes** and potential time-wasting patterns.

**Key Business Questions:**

1. How do earnings per mile and per minute vary across boroughs?
2. Are short trips in dense areas more profitable than long-distance ones?
3. When and where do drivers receive the highest tip-to-fare ratios?
4. Which zones have the lowest idle times between trips?
5. What zones and hours yield the highest net profit opportunities?

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a **Driver Efficiency Map** showing profitable pickup zones by time of day.
- Highlight patterns that maximize **earnings per working hour**.
- Recommend practical, **data-driven strategies** to reduce hidden operational costs.
- Enable a potential **10–20% increase in net income** through smarter driving strategies.

## 🛠️ Implementation

- **Dataset**: NYC TLC Trip Record (public taxi data)
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, GeoPandas, Jupyter Notebook

**Key Features:**

- Cleaning & preprocessing large-scale taxi data
- Calculating metrics like fare per mile, per minute, tip ratio, and idle time
- Spatial and temporal grouping using zone and time features
- Interactive **efficiency heatmaps** to guide driver strategy
